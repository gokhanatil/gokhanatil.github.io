Last week, I attended the Oracle Open World and gave a presentation about writing scripts with EMCLI. If you’re unfamiliar with EMCLI, it’s the command line interface for Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Here’s my presentation:

Although EMCLI is a very specific topic that appeals only to advanced users, many people attended my session. I want to thank [Ray Smith](https://oramanageability.com/) (IOUG Director of Education) for his support. He did his best to inform people about my session.

If you attended my session, or if you have just seen the presentation slides, and have questions about EMCLI scripting, please do not hesitate to ask me.
